    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is designed to streamline the submission, review, and approval of claims for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers. The system provides a comprehensive platform where lecturers can submit claims, and Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers can review, approve, or reject claims with ease.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Our mission is to improve efficiency and accuracy in claim processing, allowing educators to focus on what they do best—teaching. With CMCS, both lecturers and administrators benefit from a seamless, user-friendly interface, backed by robust features and functionalities.
